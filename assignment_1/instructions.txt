To run this program, unzip the folder, navigate to the directory of the program through the terminal,
and on windows run python Main.py or on macOs run python3 Main.py in the terminal or powershell.
After this command is ran, you will enter the program, the program will prompt you to enter a ciphertext file,
the file I have been using for testing is the file which has been provided, "sample-secret-message-caesar-ciphertext.txt".
Once this file is enter, the program will execute and it will create or overwrite to output.txt, and it will also
print to the console. The contents of these outputs will be the decrypted text along with the shift amount preceding. This 
output file should be found in the same directory as the program. 

I also included a file called sample-cipher.txt which helped me confirm my program was working with other test cases, these 
were generated using ChatGPT.
